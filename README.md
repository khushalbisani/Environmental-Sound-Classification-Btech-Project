# Urban-Sound-Classification-Btech-Project
UrbanSound8K[8] is a well known dataset  which contains recordings of total 27 hours of audio over 10 classes of acoustic sound with 18.5 hours of sound event occurrences. Classes are Children Playing , Air Conditioner, Engine Idling, Dog bark, Drilling, Gun Shot, Jackhammer, Siren, Car Horn and Street Music.
# Objectives
*To apply Deep learning architecture to classify noisy sounds.
* To learn various features of audio signals by applying various features extraction
techniques like mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient(MFCC) and mel spectrogram
representation of audio signal.
* To apply SpecAugmentation techniques.
# Prerequisite
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Librosa
* Keras
